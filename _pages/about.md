## About me
I am a programmer, who loves to write code and have been doing that professionally since September 2000.

## My Professional Experience
Started as a development engineer in then Alcatel, now [Nokia Networks](https://www.nokia.com/networks/). I also worked for a short stint in Siemens Medical Systems, developing software for their state of art x-ray and cardiolody equipments. I also have experience in developing and testing some very cool software for Railyway track measurement, when working in [Infosys](https://www.infosys.com/), consulting for [BNSF Railway](https://www.bnsf.com/). I now work for [GenDigital] (https://www.gendigital.com/), developing the Norton Security Client for Windows. 

During this period, I have mostly worked as an individual contributor. However, I also have been a technical/people manager for about 3 years, which did not appeal to me very much. I am now a Senior Principal Software Engineer, who likes to be on the ground with other programmers and get my hands dirty.
